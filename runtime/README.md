# Analysis Code
The code used for the analysis of kinematic data to investigate the effect of visual feedback distortions (VFD) on gait variability while walking on a treadmill.

> This repository already contains the calculated step parameters datasets (`./runtime/results/*.rds`). If you want to recalculate step parameters, delete these files, and put participant data ([found on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/14017075)) folders in `./runtime/data/` (in the same folder as the `index.Rmd`).
> 
> If running on a weaker CPU/low memory PC, make sure to use the non-parallel version `get_data_from_loop` instead of the parallelized version `get_data_from_loop_parallel` in the `./source/calc_all_gait_params.R` for the `calc_all_gait_params` function (otherwise will be much slower or may crash/freeze). Calculating the full gait parameter table takes roughly 10 minutes when non-parellelized, and roughly 2-3 minutes when running parellel on a good PC.

## How to use
To run this code with your local R-Studio installation:
1. Within the R instance, navigate to `./runtime/`, and open the `index.Rmd` file.
2. Click `Run Document`. If it asks you to install any packages, click yes. You can find the list of packages used in `./runtime/source/setup.R`.
> Initial calculation of the datasets may take some time (~5 minutes). After the first run, the results should be saved to tables in `results/` and startup should be significantly faster.
3. Browse the tabs and interact with the data

> NOTE: Also see [data_dictionary.md](./data_dictionary.md) for an overview of the variable names and their meaning. This also contains information on the variable names of all the tracker files in the dataset (data recorded within Unity using [UXF](https://github.com/immersivecognition/unity-experiment-framework)).

> NOTE 2: This calculation does an initial outlier selection based on rough threshold values for heelstrike positions. However, this selection is far from correctly identifying all the outliers, and so we implemented a manual outlier removal interface. To load our selected outliers and select them in the dataset, follow the instructions below.

## Remove Outliers
To reproduce the results in the paper, the outliers we manually selected still need to be removed. Follow the steps below:

1. Perform the initial calculation described above.
2. Open the **Manual Outlier Filtering** tab.
3. Find the **Import Outliers from CSV** field, and click `Browse`. Now select the outliers csv under: `./runtime/data_extra/outliers-2024-11-28.csv` and import them.
4. Make sure the *outlier matching threshold value* is still set to `0.1`s (this affects the outlier selection, if set larger, a larget timespan is used to remove outliers around the selected timestamps in the outlier dataset).
5. Click **Overwrite Outliers** to write the outliers to the dataset loaded in the interface.
6. Optional: Click **Save current parameters to RDS** and overwrite the previously calculated rds under `./runtime/results/allGaitParams.rds` so that the next time you load the interface, these outliers will already be marked in the dataset.

## Contents
- `index.Rmd` - The main Rmd code to run that loads all the source code, calculates or loads the results, and renders all the pages + sidebar. --> Run this code to start the interface.
    - The first block in this file (setup block) loads all the source code and calculates the heelstrikes and results. The first time this is done, it creates Rds files in the results folder, which will be loaded instead of calculated in subsequent runs. To recalculate the datasets, simply delete the old ones, and re-run this first block (or the whole file).
    - Then a series of pages are loaded. For an overview of each page, see below.

- `data/` - Contains all data of all participants.
- `pages/` - Contains the Rmd code for rendering the shiny pages + sidebar (shown below).
- `source/` - Contains the source code for the calculation of all the parameters etc. Note: also contains a `README.md`.
- `questionnaires/` - Contains information about the questionnaire questions (how to calculate the results, categories within the questionnaire, etc.).
- `results/` - Folder in which the resulting tables are stored (calculated gait parameters, target parameters, questionnaire results).

### Page 0: `sidebar_dynamicDataFiltering.Rmd`

some general info:

- `sidebar_dynamicDataFiltering.Rmd`
The first "page" is the sidebar. This contains some settings that are shared across all pages. Most critical of this are the filtering settings, allowing you to filter out steps / trials / participants. There are also settings that change the figure sizes. (Sidebar is shown below in the screenshot of page1). Note that the filtered data is used for all plots and statistics calculations, and so changing these settings affects all the plots.

- Categories explanation:
    Some pages, or filters in the sidebar have selectors for categories (e.g., the histograms), which allow you to split the data for that visualization. These categories are:
    - **participant**: split data per participant
    - **trialNum**: split data by trial number (1=practice, 2, 3, 4=practice, 5, or 6)
    - **practice**: categorize data based on whether it's a practice trial (trials 1 and 4) or not (the rest) (TRUE or FALSE)
    - **startedWithNoise**: separate data based on whether the participant started with VFD (noise) condition or not (TRUE or FALSE)
    - **conditionNumber**: categorize data by condition number (first or second)
    - **trialNumWithoutPractice**: split data by trial number, excluding practice trials (1, 2, 3, or 4)
    - **trialNumWithinCondition**: categorize data by trial number within each condition (1 or 2, or 0 for practise)
    - **noticed**: split data based on whether the participant noticed the VFD during the experiment (asked each participant after their experiment, and noted this in the data). (TRUE or FALSE)
- Some pages allow additional options:
    - Average data across conditions - take average of the two trials of each participant and each condition.
    - Calculate difference + means per participant - Calculate the difference from baseline to VFD condition, as well as mean of both conditions.
